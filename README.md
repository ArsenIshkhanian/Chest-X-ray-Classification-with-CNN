# ðŸ©º Chest X-ray Classification with CNN  

A deep learning project to classify chest X-ray images into **Pneumonia** or **Normal** categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in TensorFlow/Keras.  

This project was inspired by a Kaggle competition and achieved promising accuracy on the test set.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

I used the **Chest X-ray Images for Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning** dataset, created by Tolga Dincer. It contains:

- **5,856** validated chest X-ray images
- Organized into **train** and **test** folders
- Two categories: **Normal** vs **Pneumonia**

**Note:**  
For this project, I used **only the training data** to train my model.  
For quick testing, I selected a **single random image** instead of using the full test set.
