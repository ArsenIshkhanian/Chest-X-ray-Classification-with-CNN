# ðŸ©º Chest X-ray Classification with CNN  

A deep learning project to classify chest X-ray images into **Pneumonia** or **Normal** categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in TensorFlow/Keras.  

This project was inspired by a Kaggle competition and achieved promising accuracy on the test set.

##  Dataset

I used the **Chest X-ray Images for Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning** dataset, created by Tolga Dincer. It contains:

- **5,856** validated chest X-ray images
- Clearly divided into independent **training** and **testing** sets by patient
- Suitable for binary classification: **Normal** vs **Pneumonia**
